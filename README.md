# Transformer API

This is a lightweight Python API that exposes a REST endpoint to generate sentence embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Sentence Transformers.

## What it does

It exposes a single POST endpoint /embed that takes a list of input texts and returns their vector representations, ready to be stored or queried against a vector database like Qdrant.

## Quickstart

Build and run the API in Docker:

``` bash
docker build -t transformer-api .
docker run -d --name transformer-api -p 8000:8000 transformer-api
```
The API will now be available at http://localhost:8000/embed

## Usage

Make a POST request to the /embed endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/embed \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"texts": ["A nice sentence to transform"]}'
```

Example response:
```bash
{
"vectors": [
[0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...]  // Vector of floats
]
}
```
